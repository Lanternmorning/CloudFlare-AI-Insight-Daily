It seems much better than other contemporary chatbots like SimSimi. It adapts to user engagement and user generated text very quickly, adjusting the text it generates which is grammatically coherent and apparently context appropriate and contains information unlike SimSimi. There is zero information on its inner workings. Could it just have been RL on an RNN trained on text and answer pairs? Maybe Markov chains too? How can an AI model like this learn continuously? Could it have used Long short-term memory?

I built SpeechLab to bridge the gap between \"script-kiddie\" training loops and production-grade infrastructure.</p> <p><strong>Key Architecture Decisions:</strong></p> <ol> <li><strong>Orchestration:</strong> Used Ray Train instead of raw torch.distributed to handle worker failures programmatically. If a node dies, the Ray Actor pool respawns it from the last checkpoint automatically.</li> <li><strong>Data Streaming:</strong> Implemented a streaming Ray Data pipeline with look-ahead prefetching. This decouples GPU compute from CPU audio preprocessing (Mel-spectrogram extraction), solving the GPU starvation issue common in ASR tasks.</li> <li><strong>Observability:</strong> Built a custom WebSocket-based dashboard (Next.js/FastAPI) to visualize WER/CER in real-time, rather than waiting for TensorBoard logs to sync.</li> </ol> <p><strong>Results:</strong><br> Achieved near-linear scaling (94% efficiency) on a 2-node cluster vs single-node baseline.</p> <p>I’m currently looking for feedback on the sharding strategy for datasets larger than 10TB. If anyone has experience optimizing Ray object store for audio, let me know!</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/New_Care3681\" target=\"_blank\"> /u/New_Care3681 </a> <br> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1qn2xq6/p_speechlab_a_faulttolerant_distributed_training/\" target=\"_blank\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1qn2xq6/p_speechlab_a_faulttolerant_distributed_training/\" target=\"_blank\">[comments]</a></span>"

It's a simple site with a straightforward goal: to track the stories of people who have been replaced by AI, automation, or robots. The idea isn't to hate on AI (I don't!), but to create a space to talk about the human side of this big technological shift.</p> <p>If you've been impacted, please come share your story. I've kept things simple... There's no user authentication, just some basic rate limiting and cloudflare to prevent spam. All posts are manually approved to keep the content respectful and on-topic. After enough posts are submitted, you will be able to see a very simple post carousel (that will be expanded on in the future).</p> <p>The entire project is open source. You can find the source code on <a href=\"https://github.com/Michaelpalacce/ReplacedBy\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a>. I'm not a designer, so a lot of the UI is AI-assisted (I hooked up the components, made them reactive, then AI placed it nicely... even tho honestly it kept messing up, but whatver). You can also find the AI disclosure in the repo's README.</p> <p>There is a bit of data pre-seeded, a sort of best-effort research on my end and based on articles that wre concrete in who and how was impacted. The list is by no means complete, so if you feel strongly about a mass layoff that happened, do open an issue and I will add it.</p> <p>There's a <a href=\"https://github.com/Michaelpalacce/ReplacedBy?tab=readme-ov-file#Roadmap\" target=\"_blank\">roadmap</a> in the repo if you're curious about what's next.</p> <p>I plan to do monthly posts with how the site has grown and the data collected.</p> <p>Let me know what you think!</p> </div>   submitted by   <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/stefantigro\" target=\"_blank\"> /u/stefantigro </a> <br> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1qmxxen/replaced_by/\" target=\"_blank\">[link]</a></span>   <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1qmxxen/replaced_by/\" target=\"_blank\">[comments]</a></span>"
