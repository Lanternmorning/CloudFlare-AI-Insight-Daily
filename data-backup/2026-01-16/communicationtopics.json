Unlike 5G, where AI and machine learning were limited applications or add-on features over existing architecture, 6G will incorporate AI from the onset with an “AI native” approach where intelligence will allow the network to be smart, agile, and able to learn and adapt according to changing network dynamics.</p>\n<p>This transformation is necessary because future 6G networks will be too complex for human operators to manage, requiring AI-empowered and learning-driven networks that can facilitate zero-touch network management through capabilities including learning, reasoning, and decision-making.</p>\n<div><strong>Key Developments and Analysis:</strong></div>\n<ul class=\"\">\n<li><span><strong>AI-Native Networks:</strong> The industry consensus is that 6G will be “<strong>AI-native</strong>,” meaning artificial intelligence will be built directly into the core functions of network control, resource management, and service orchestration. This moves AI from an optimization layer in 5G to an foundational element in 6G.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://techblog.comsoc.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-15-170936.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://techblog.comsoc.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-15-170936.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"764\" height=\"713\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>AI Native Image Courtesy of Ericsson</strong></p>\n<p>…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………</p>\n<ul class=\"\">\n<li><span><strong>Company Initiatives:</strong></span>\n<ul class=\"\">\n<li>Huawei is focused on making <strong>AI a native element of the network architecture</strong> (AI-native 6G) rather than an overlay technology, integrating communication, sensing, computing, and intelligence. This vision, called “Connected Intelligence,” involves two aspects: <strong>AI for 6G (network automation)</strong> and <strong>6G for AI (AI as a Service, AIaaS).  </strong>More in Huawei Research Areas below.</li>\n<li><span><strong>Samsung</strong> is a major proponent of AI-RAN (Radio Access Network) technology. The company hosted a summit in November 2025 to showcase working AI-RAN technology that autonomously optimizes network performance and is conducting joint research with SK Telecom (SKT) on AI-supported RAN. Samsung sees vRAN (virtualized RAN) as a key enabler for “AI-native, 6G-ready networks”.</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Ericsson</strong> emphasizes the necessity of a strong 5G Standalone (5G SA) foundation for an AI future, using AI to manage and automate current networks in preparation for 6G’s demands. Ericsson is also integrating agentic AI into its platforms for more autonomous network management.</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Nokia</strong> is deepening its AI push, licensing software to expand AI use in mobile networks and preparing for early field trials in 2026 by porting baseband software to platforms like NVIDIA’s, which opens the door for more advanced AI use cases.</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><span><strong>Industry Analysis and Trends:</strong></span>\n<ul class=\"\">\n<li><span><strong>Standardization:</strong> 2026 is crucial as formal 6G specification work begins in earnest within 3GPP with Release 21. In WP5D, the IMT 2030 RIT/SRIT standardization work will commence at the <strong>February 2027 </strong>meeting with the final deadline for submissions at the <strong>February 2029 </strong>meeting<strong>. </strong> More in the ITU-R WP5D section below.  </span></li>\n<li><span>The <strong>AI-RAN Alliance</strong> is an industry initiative (not a traditional SDO) focused on accelerating real-world AI applications and integration within the RAN. It works alongside SDOs, providing industry insights and pushing for rapid validation and testing of AI-RAN technologies, with a specific focus on leveraging accelerated computing.</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Automation and Efficiency:</strong> AI-native algorithms in 6G are expected to deliver extreme spectrum and energy efficiency, significantly reducing operational costs for telcos while improving reliability and performance.</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Monetization Challenges:</strong> Despite the technological promise, analysts caution that 6G remains largely theoretical for now. Some operators are stalling on full 5G SA deployment, waiting to move to 6G-ready cores later in the decade, leading to concerns that 5G SA might become an “odd generation.”</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Infrastructure Constraints:</strong> The physical demands of AI infrastructure, particularly energy consumption and construction timelines, are becoming operational realities that may bound the pace of AI growth in 2026, regardless of software advancements.</span><span><span> </span></span></li>\n<li><strong>ITU-R Working Party (WP) 5D</strong> is making AI a <strong>native and foundational element</strong> <strong>of the 6G (IMT-2030) system</strong>, rather than the “add-on” or “overlay” status it had in 5G (IMT 2020). This shift is being achieved through the definition of specific <strong>AI capabilities and requirements</strong> that future 6G technologies must inherently support. In particular:</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><span><strong>Defining AI as a Core Capability:</strong> The <em>Recommendation ITU-R M.2160</em> (“Framework and overall objectives of the future development of IMT for 2030 and Beyond”) officially defines “Artificial Intelligence and Communication” as one of the six major usage scenarios and an overarching design principle for IMT-2030.</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Integrating AI into the Radio Interface:</strong> WP 5D is actively developing technical performance requirements (TPRs) and evaluation criteria for proposed 6G radio interface technologies (RITs) that inherently incorporate AI/Machine Learning (ML). This includes work on:</span>\n<ul class=\"\">\n<li><span><strong>AI-enabled air interface design:</strong> This involves the physical layer, potentially moving towards AI-native physical (PHY) layers that can dynamically adapt waveforms and network parameters in real-time, rather than relying on predefined, static configurations.</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>AI-driven resource management:</strong> AI/ML algorithms will be crucial for real-time optimization of spectral and energy efficiency, managing complex traffic, and ensuring Quality of Service (QoS).</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><span><strong>Enabling AI-Driven Services:</strong> The framework for IMT-2030 is designed to support the full lifecycle of AI components, from data collection and model training to deployment and performance monitoring, enabling new AI-driven services and applications directly within the network infrastructure.</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Establishing a Formal Timeline:</strong> WP 5D has established a clear timeline for 6G standardization, with specific stages for vision, requirements, evaluation methodology, and specifications. This structured approach ensures that all proposed RITs/SRITs are evaluated against the new AI-native requirements, promoting global alignment and preventing AI from becoming a fragmented, proprietary solution.</span>\n<ul class=\"\">\n<li><span><strong>Stage 1 (Vision):</strong> Completed in June 2023.</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Stage 2 (Requirements &#x26; Evaluation):</strong> Targeted for completion in 2026.</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Stage 3 (Specifications):</strong> Expected by the end of 2030.</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div>6G, as envisioned in the <strong>ITU-R’s IMT-2030</strong> framework, is being designed from the ground up as an “AI-native” system.<span><span> </span></span></div>\n<ul class=\"\">\n<li><span><strong>Purpose:</strong> AI is integral to the entire network lifecycle, from initial design and deployment to autonomous operation and service creation.</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Integration Level:</strong> Intelligence is embedded across all layers of the network stack, including the physical layer (air interface), control plane, and data plane.</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Scope:</strong> AI enables core functionalities such as real-time self-optimization, self- healing capabilities, and dynamic resource allocation, rather than static, predefined configurations.</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Outcome:</strong> The creation of a fully cognitive, self-managing, and highly adaptable “intelligence fabric” capable of supporting advanced use cases like real-time holographic communication, digital twins, and autonomous systems with ultra-low latency.</span><span><span> </span></span></li>\n</ul>\n<div><strong>Comparing AI as an overlay in 5G (IMT 2030) vs AI native mode in 6G (IMT 2030):</strong></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th colspan=\"undefined\">Feature<span><span> </span></span></th>\n<th colspan=\"undefined\">5G (IMT-2020)</th>\n<th colspan=\"undefined\">6G (IMT-2030)</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"undefined\"><strong>AI Role</strong></td>\n<td colspan=\"undefined\">Optimization tool (overlay)</td>\n<td colspan=\"undefined\">Foundational and native element</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"undefined\"><strong>Network Operation</strong></td>\n<td colspan=\"undefined\">Manual configuration with AI assistance</td>\n<td colspan=\"undefined\">Autonomous and self-managing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"undefined\"><strong>Air Interface</strong></td>\n<td colspan=\"undefined\">Human-designed with some ML optimization</td>\n<td colspan=\"undefined\">AI/ML-designed and managed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"undefined\"><strong>Complexity Management</strong></td>\n<td colspan=\"undefined\">Relies on standard protocols</td>\n<td colspan=\"undefined\">Manages complexity through embedded AI/ML</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"undefined\"><strong>Services Supported</strong></td>\n<td colspan=\"undefined\">Enhanced mobile broadband, basic IoT</td>\n<td colspan=\"undefined\">Integrated AI &#x26; Communication, sensing, holographic comms</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>–>By embedding AI into the fundamental design principles and technical requirements of IMT-2030, ITU-R WP 5D is ensuring that 6G is an <strong>AI-native network</strong> capable of self-management, self-optimization, and supporting a vast ecosystem of AI applications, a significant shift from the supplementary role AI played in 5G.<span><span> </span></span></p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div id=\"user-content-shrproxyt4dpaYXXHaKMvMcP2JejUA_1\">\n<div>……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div><strong>Huawei’s Research Areas and Activities:</strong></div>\n<ul class=\"\">\n<li><span><strong>Agentic-AI Core (A-Core):</strong> Huawei unveiled a blueprint for a <strong>6G core network</strong> (which will be specified by 3GPP and NOT ITU) where services are managed by specialized AI agents using a large-scale network AI model called “NetGPT”. This allows the network to program, update, and execute its own control procedures automatically without human intervention, based on natural language instructions.</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Network Architecture Redesign:</strong> Huawei proposes the <strong>NET4AI</strong> system architecture, a service-oriented design that moves beyond the 5G service-based architecture. It introduces a dedicated data plane (DP) to handle the massive volume of data generated by AI and sensing services, enabling flexible and efficient many-to-many data flow for distributed learning and inference.</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC):</strong> A core pillar of Huawei’s 6G work is the native integration of sensing with communication. This allows the network to use radio waves for high-resolution sensing, localization, and imaging, creating a “digital twin” of the physical world. The large volume of data collected from sensing then serves as a source for AI model training and real-time environmental monitoring.</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Distributed Machine Learning:</strong> Huawei researches deep-edge architecture to enable massive, distributed, and collaborative machine learning (ML). This includes the development of frameworks like a two-level learning architecture that combines federated learning (FL) and split learning (SL) to optimize computing resources and ensure data privacy by keeping raw data local to devices.</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>AI as a Service (AIaaS):</strong> The 6G network is designed to provide AI capabilities as a service, allowing the training and inference of large AI models to be distributed across the network (edge and cloud). This offers low-latency performance and access to rich data for AI-driven applications like collaborative robotics and autonomous driving.</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Energy Efficiency and Sustainability:</strong> The company is researching how native AI capabilities can improve overall energy efficiency by up to 100 times compared to 5G. This involves smart energy control, dynamic resource scaling, and optimizing communication paths for lower power consumption.</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>Standardization and White Papers:</strong> Huawei is actively contributing to global 6G discussions and standardization bodies like the ITU-R, sharing its vision through publications such as the book <em>6G: The Next Horizon – From Connected People and Things to Connected Intelligence</em> and various technical white papers. The goal is to define the technical specifications and use cases for 6G that will drive industry-wide innovation by around 2030.</span><span><span> </span></span></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div>In summary, the telecom industry is laying the critical groundwork for an AI-native 6G era through research, standard setting, and strategic investments in AI-powered network solutions, even as commercial deployment remains several years away. Decisions must be made on spectrum use (especially in the FR3 range of 7-24 GHz), silicon roadmaps, and network architectures which will have lasting impact.</div>\n<div>………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..</div>\n<h2><strong>References:</strong></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ericsson.com/en/reports-and-papers/white-papers/ai-native\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ericsson.com/en/reports-and-papers/white-papers/ai-native</a></p>\n<h2 class=\"\"><a href=\"https://techblog.comsoc.org/2026/01/02/roles-of-3gpp-and-itu-r-wp-5d-in-the-imt-2030-6g-standards-process/\" target=\"_blank\">Roles of 3GPP and ITU-R WP 5D in the IMT 2030/6G standards process</a></h2>\n<div>\n<h2 class=\"\"><a href=\"https://techblog.comsoc.org/2025/12/12/ai-wireless-and-fiber-optic-network-technologies-imt-2030-native-ai-concept/\" target=\"_blank\">AI wireless and fiber optic network technologies;
